As part of my virtual data science internship program with British Airways, I had the opportunity to step into the shoes of a British Airways team member and complete tasks that replicate the work that their Data Science team does every day, therefore learning how to scrape customer review data and building predictive models.

The first part of the project consisted in web scraping tasks to gain customer insights. This also included data cleaning, text classification and results' visualization.

The second task concerned the prediction of customers' buying behaviors, therefore using data manipulation, analysis, and visualization along with machine learning prediction algorithms, namely the random forest algorithm.
